About the app
For the first semester, I have created a portfolio website and a small online shop that sells books inside it. This time, I wanted to create an application that is helpful for bookworms. What does it do? It asks users to input the name of the book which they want to read. As soon as they finish reading the book, they click the book and it appears in the list of finished books. In case the user wants to delete one of the books in the finished books list, it is also available by just one click. 

Running the app
For this application, I have used 4 dependencies. Here they are: body-parser, ejs, express, nodemon. There was one more which is mongoose, but as it was not working currently, I was not able to use it in my project. Some of these dependencies are not really required to sun the application locally. One example is nodemon which is only useful during the development process. I have used the ejs file to structure my UI. I have created the application relying on the functionality of express which has several advantages compared to vanilla NodeJs. In order to run the application, they are just required to install these dependencies only.
